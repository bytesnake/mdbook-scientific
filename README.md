# Scientific mdbook plugin
This plugin adds functionality to `mdbook` for scientific application. It allows the writer to generate named LaTeX, named Gnuplots and supports `bibtex` files. Further cross-referencing in text to equation, figures or literature is possible. A sample output can be seen [here](https://bytesnake.github.io/mdbook_example/).

## Install

Compile this crate and add the `mdbook-scientific` to your search path. Also [bib2xhtml](https://github.com/dspinellis/bib2xhtml) is required if you want to generate a bibliography. Then add the following to your `book.toml`:
```
[preprocessor.scientific]
renderer = ["html"]

bibliography = "literature.bib"
bib2xhtml = "/home/lorenz/Documents/tmp/bib2xhtml/"

assets = "src/"

[output.html]
additional-css = ["src/scientific.css"]
```

For latex rendering `latex` and `dvisvgm` are required. For gnuplot rendering the `gnuplot` binary.

## Syntax

For block equation rendering use the following syntax

```
$$equation, <name>
...
$$
```

the `equation` identifier is only needed if you want to name the equation block. You can cross-reference it then with `$ref:equ:<name>$` in the whole `mdbook`.

The same syntax is working with `latex` and `gnuplot` figures, both are requiring a subtitle for the plot. Further a `gnuplotonly` figure only uses Gnuplot to render the file to SVG.

Example for gnuplot rendering
```
$$gnuplot, <name>, <subtitle>
...
$$
```
and then cross-reference with `$ref:fig:<name>$`.

The BibTeX file referenced in the configuration file is added as a additional chapter and citations can be generated with `$ref:bib:<name>$`.

## Should I use this
Nope, it's still in its infancy. Please don't use it yet.
